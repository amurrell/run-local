# run-local (rl)

A more custom way to do local development, where a bash script saves you/your team from long READMEs and context switching. Friendly prompts and shortcuts to get anyone up to speed quickly.

> [!TIP]
> Ideal for laravel, wordpress, or nodejs projects, where you have a database dump, image assets, or env variables. Really ideal if you have a lot of these projects and want consistency and ease to switch between them, onboard new team members, or just make your life easier.

Used with [DockerLocal](https://github.com/amurrell/DockerLocal) for Docker container creation.

### Usage

```bash
‚ùØ ./run-local

### Requirements

- Docker Desktop ([install docs](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/))
- [DockerLocal](https://github.com/amurrell/DockerLocal) is a submodule in this repo at the root.
- **nvm** - Node Version Manager
- **Assets & Data Prep:** You have access to `env` variables, database dump mariadb/mysql (sql), image assets (archive), and are running PHP or NodeJS projects.

### Steps

To **add run-local as your local development tool**, follow these steps as a 1-time process per project.

1. `cd YOURPROJECT` - Navigate to your project directory.
1. Use wget or curl to copy run-local, rl-vars, rl-alias

   ```bash
   # wget
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amurrell/run-local/main/run-local && chmod +x run-local
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amurrell/run-local/main/rl-vars && chmod +x rl-vars
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amurrell/run-local/main/rl-alias && chmod +x rl-alias
   ```

   <details>
      <summary>See: Curl</summary>

   ```bash
   # curl
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amurrell/run-local/main/run-local && chmod +x run-local
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amurrell/run-local/main/rl-vars && chmod +x rl-vars
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amurrell/run-local/main/rl-alias && chmod +x rl-alias
   ```

   </details>

   ***

1. Populate **rl-vars** with your project details

   <details>
      <summary>See: rl-vars snippet</summary>

   ```bash
   PROJECT_NAME="üê£ YOUR PROJECT"

   # Relevant Use Case: create_default_file function
   DEFAULT_PORT="3000"
   DEFAULT_DB_NAME="myprojectdb"
   DEFAULT_WEB_SERVER_ROOT="/var/www/site/html"
   DEFAULT_PHP_VERSION="8.2"
   DEFAULT_UBUNTU_RELEASE_NAME="jammy"
   DEFAULT_UBUNTU_VERSION="22.04"
   DEFAULT_YAML_VERSION="2.2.3"
   DEFAULT_NVM_VERSION="18.17.1"
   DEFAULT_DB_IMAGE="mariadb:10.6" # can choose mysql or mariadb
   # ... more
   ```

   </details>

   ***

1. Copy [README-TEMPLATE](./README-TEMPLATE.md) or relevant parts to your Project's README. This is how others will **setup their local development** with run-local once it's committed to your project, with your own `rl-vars`, `rl-extended`, and `rl-funcs`.

1. Consider adding `rl-extended` and `rl-funcs` functions for your project, changing however you need, adding only relevant ones, your making your own, based on these.

   ```bash
   # rl-extended
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amurrell/run-local/main/rl-extended && chmod +x rl-extended
   # composer
   mkdir -p rl-funcs && cd rl-funcs
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amurrell/run-local/main/rl-funcs/rl-composer && chmod +x rl-composer
   # artisan (Laravel)
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amurrell/run-local/main/rl-funcs/rl-artisan && chmod +x rl-artisan
   ```

   <details>
      <summary>See: Curl</summary>

   ```bash
   # rl-extended
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amurrell/run-local/main/rl-extended && chmod +x rl-extended
   # composer
   mkdir -p rl-funcs && cd rl-funcs
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amurrell/run-local/main/rl-funcs/rl-composer && chmod +x rl-composer
   # artisan (Laravel)
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amurrell/run-local/main/rl-funcs/rl-artisan && chmod +x rl-artisan
   ```

   </details>

1. Run `./run-local install` and follow the prompts, using your copy of the `README-TEMPLATE` as a guide (and make notes in it as you go). If your project is not yet a git repo, it will ask you to `git init`. If you do not have `DockerLocal`, it will be pulled in as a submodule for you.

### rl alias

The `rl` alias is a shortcut to run the `run-local.sh` script. You can run it from **anywhere** and it will prompt for which run-local project you want to run when you have multiple projects in a code directory (defined by `RL_DEV_FOLDER` in your shell profile).

**Usage**

```bash
# from anywhere
‚ùØ rl up
Available run-local scripts:
1) ~/code/<specific-project>
2) ~/code/<specific-project>
3) ~/code/sub-projects/<specific-project>
Select a run-local script to execute:
```

<details>
   <summary>See: Manual Setup</summary>

If you already have an **rl-alias**, you can skip this step.

```bash
‚ùØ alias rl
rl=rl
```

If you do not have it in your shell profile (eg. `~/.zshrc`), you can add it manually.

**Update Values** for `DEV_FOLDER` (above your project) and `SHELL_PROFILE`, **Change Directory** to project root, where `rl-alias` is located, and then paste in your terminal all at once:

```bash
# Update these values
DEV_FOLDER=${HOME}/code
SHELL_PROFILE=${HOME}/.zshrc

ln -s rl-alias "$DEV_FOLDER/rl-alias"
echo "# Run Local Alias" >> "$SHELL_PROFILE"
echo "RL_DEV_FOLDER=${DEV_FOLDER}" >> "$SHELL_PROFILE"
echo "source $DEV_FOLDER/rl-alias" >> "$SHELL_PROFILE"
source "$SHELL_PROFILE"
```
